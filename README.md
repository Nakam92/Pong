# README - Pong Game with Processing

## Introduction

This project is a simple Pong game developed using the Processing software. The game features a player-controlled paddle, a computer-controlled paddle, and a bouncing ball. The objective is to bounce the ball on the player's paddle to score points while avoiding letting the ball reach the left side of the screen.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the Processing software installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Processing website](https://processing.org/download/).

### Execution

1. Open the source file `pong_processing.pde` with Processing.
2. Press the "Run" button (or use the shortcut Ctrl + R) to start the game.

## Controls

- **Pause:** Press the 'P' key to pause or resume the game.

## Game Rules

1. The player scores points each time the ball bounces on their paddle.
2. The ball bounces off the screen edges and the computer's paddle.
3. If the ball reaches the left side of the screen, the player loses a life.
4. The game ends when the player runs out of lives.
5. The elapsed time since the start of the game is displayed at the end of the game.

## Features
